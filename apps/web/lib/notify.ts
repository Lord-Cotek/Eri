/**
 * Notification delivery.
 *
 * Two channels: an in-app record (always) and email (when SMTP is configured).
 * Push is a phase-2 concern and belongs with the native sentinels; the shape
 * here is already the shape a push payload would take.
 *
 * PRIVACY INVARIANT — read the templates below. Every one of them is a fixed
 * string interpolating a category *label*, a clock time, and a state. None of
 * them accepts content, and none of them can, because there is no content in
 * the system to pass. The one variable string that ever reaches an ally is the
 * subject's own disclosure note, which he wrote and chose to send.
 *
 * The other rule this module enforces: **the ally is told nothing during the
 * grace window.** Not that an event is pending, not a count, not a hint.
 * `notifyAllyOfResolution` refuses to run on a PENDING event.
